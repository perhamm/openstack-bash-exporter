## K8s quick start

The variables to use the openstack command are taken from the cluster, for which the first step is to run create_cloud_clonfig_file.sh

## Usage

```console
Usage of ./openstack-bash-exporter:
  -debug

  -interval int
    	Interval for metrics collection in seconds (default 300)
  -web.listen-address string
